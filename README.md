# DevOps Apprenticeship: Project Exercise

## Getting started

The project uses a virtual environment to isolate package dependencies. To create the virtual environment and install required packages, run the following from a bash shell terminal:

### On macOS and Linux
```bash
$ source setup.sh
```
### On Windows (Using Git Bash)
```bash
$ source setup.sh --windows
```

Once the setup script has completed and all packages have been installed, start the Flask app by running:
```bash
$ flask run
```

You should see output similar to the following:
```bash
 * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with fsevents reloader
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 226-556-590
```
Now visit [`http://localhost:5000/`](http://localhost:5000/) in your web browser to view the app.


### Using poetry
You can use `poetry install` and `poetry run flask run` to install and run the app respectively. This requires `python = ^3.8.1` and `poetry` to be installed

### Running Tests
#### Commands
```python
poetry shell
pytest tests  # run unit and integration tests
pytest tests_e2e  # run e2e tests
```

Note that running `pytest` doesn't work because of different .env files used
